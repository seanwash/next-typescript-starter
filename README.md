## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Tools & Libraries

I've bootstrapped this repo with a few of the tools that I like:

* [Next.js + TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs) - React meta-framework.
* [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) - Handles E2E testing as well as component level unit testing.
* [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - A minimal but powerful form abstraction. I prefer to stick to vanilla HTML when I can, but RHF provides a nice API to augment the DOM with without jumping ship to totally custom components.
* [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - Fetch, cache and update data in your React and React Native applications all without touching any "global state".

I wanted to make sure to get some of the more boring configuration stuff out of the way so that when inspiration strikes I can get right to building. There are few things less inspiring than having to slog through boilerplate.
